# SimpleSAMLphp Session Source Module

This module has been created to verify if an user is authenticated by using his sessionId. It is usefull for a back office server who can't manage cookies. 

**Example** :

1. A webmail authenticate the users with SimpleSAMLphp.
2. The module add in attributes a token. This token is given to the IMAP server as the password.
3. The IMAP server access to the module to verify the authentication.



## Compatibility

The module has been tester with SimpleSAMLphp v1.19. It's can't work with the v1.16 wich don't allow to load a session with a sessionId.

The sessions handler must been set to memcache or redis or sql. Don't work with phpsession.



## Installation

You can download this module directely and install it in the module directory of SimpleSAMLphp.

Other solution with composer : 

```shell
composer require svgta/simplesamlphp-module-svgtasession
```

Check the config-template directory of the module and copy the config file in your config directory of SimpleSAMLphp.

Create in the <u>authorizedKeys.php</u> file a secure key. This will be necessary to the backend server to access to the module and avoid to been acceded by everyone. For exemple :

```shell
openssl rand -base64 24
```

Add the key in the array of the config file.  For example, you will have :

```php
$config = [
	'keys' => [
		'He3NcVl0cK0WZAO4SUgOC8UZPgvtuhQs',
	 ],
];
```



Finally, add the authoproc to the SP (in file **metada/saml20-sp-remote**)

```php
'authproc' => array(
	10 => array(
		'class' => 'core:PHP',
		'code' => '
			$attributes["token"] = [\SimpleSAML\Module\svgtasession\ses::setToken()];
		',
	),	
),
```

This will add the attribute **token** for the SP.

If you are on your SP application, you can generate the token by calling

```php
$token = \SimpleSAML\Module\svgtasession\ses::setToken();
```



## What is this token ?

The token is generated by using the sessionId and the authority used in the current session. It's a json encrypted with the key of the SimpleSAMLphp created for the main config file.

This token is uncrypted and controlled by the module when it's sended by the backoffice server.



## URL to access 

The verifications must been done on the SimpleSAMLphp instance where the token has been generated.

To very if the session is avalable : 

```shell
https://yourSimpleSAMLphp_fqdn/authent/module.php/svgtasession/isAuth
```

To verify and receive the attributes 

```
https://yourSimpleSAMLphp_fqdn/authent/module.php/svgtasession/getData.php
```

They give back a json and a response status : 200 if the all is ok. 401 and 403 can been tested by the backoffice server two. Other codes are error.

The json is like this : 

```json
{
	"success": true/false, -> if false status code other than 200
	"error": "the error" -> only if an error has been intercepted
	"data": attributes -> only if getData is used, given in form key=>value
}
```



## Access from backoffice

The backoffice server need to send the headers : 

```shell
'Accept: application/json'
'Content-Type: application/json'
'Authorization: Bearer key' -> The key must be one of these in the array of  **authorizedKeys.php** file.
```

------

**Troobleshooting on headers**

Your Nginx ou Apache server may not send the Authorization header to simpleSAMLphp. In this case user the header by X-Auth-Token

```shell
'Authorization: Bearer key' become 'X-Auth-Token: key'
```

------



The method must be **POST**.

The token must been sent in a json format :

```json
{"token": "the token given in the attributes"}
```



Example with curl : 

```shell
curl -H 'Accept:application/json' \
	-H 'Authorization: Bearer He3NcVl0cK0WZAO4SUgOC8UZPgvtuhQs' \
	-H 'X-Auth-Token: He3NcVl0cK0WZAO4SUgOC8UZPgvtuhQs' \
	-d '{"token":"8b45ddabc9d0e2f4452371516829234a285fce7dde161e26173fbd53b5a7c8c9267d508ead8d3ac31280e585149b0fa8dbebe244a3f79d6cec1ae0ed11175424a01a9b97ef86ab81c5e85ca530d5217dad52267c99bb665b2da41cda3ccfee58784b0e86dab6b26a8ae25efbf166d52a90fcc46241d8aa8469c06ba42469ba01"}' \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-X POST 'https://yourSimpleSAMLphp_fqdn/authent/module.php/svgtasession/getData.php'
```
